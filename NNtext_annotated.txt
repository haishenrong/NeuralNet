function BACK-PROP-LEARNING(examples, network ) returns a neural network
inputs: examples, a set of examples, each with input vector x and output vector y
network , a multilayer network with L layers, weights wi,j , activation function g
local variables: Δ, a vector of errors, indexed by network node
